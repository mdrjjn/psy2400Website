					<h2>My Revelations</h2>
					<h3><a id="sc"></a>Social Psychology’s Place in the Social Sciences</h3>
          <p>
            One of the messages of chapter 1 that resonated with me is the “Social Psychology’s Place in the Social Sciences”, and more specifically, how it is used to understand new disciplines that study our society. For example, social psychology research complement sociology by providing an inside-out approach to explaining social phenomena.
          </p>
					<p>
            Two months ago I have stumbled on a book by Pascal Boyer called “Minds Make Societies,” which among other things argues that societies - incredibly complex and adaptive structures that drove our species to the dominant position we enjoy today - are a comprised of many autonomous individuals and, therefore, have properties that can be seen as an aggregate of human behavior in a social context (what social psychologies study). It is this theory - that human economic and political institutions can be studied as products and extensions of interactions we have with each other - that captured my thinking and led me to taking this class. One of the more interesting conclusions I was able to achieve is the entire demystification of the structures that previously seemed so rigid. For example before, the political system seemed to me rigid institution that operated in an arbitrary way defined God-knows-when. Now however, I see it as a living (although given how old they are, not for too long) collection of people that make decisions given their own biases and preferences, as well as how their group is like. I am looking to learning more about social psychology to see more revealing insights like this that will help me make sense of the world I see around and live in, as well as notice its flaws and be able to change it.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="selfc"></a>Self-schemas</h3>
            <p>A belief people hold about themselves that guides the processing of self-relevant information.</p>
          <p>
            What resonated with me was the quote from slide 10 of this Thursday's lecture that “people who identify with two cultures may have different self-schema for each culture.” It struck a chord because it put a name and thereby illuminated something I had felt for quite some time. I am Russian but have spent the majority of my conscious life abroad and I often notice that depending on the culture around me, I adjust my self-schema as to who I am. When surrounded by my American friends, I find myself to be quite patriotic if not outright belligerent in my praise of Russia. I have a set of shirts with ironically shirtless Putin, a Russian flag and a clip of militaristic jokes ready. However, when I am in Russia or around Russians, I make it a point to express how Westernized I am by way of using English words, mentioning where I go to school and being as anti-Putin as one can be(within one’s fear of the guy, of course (<-- joke)).
Before I thought that this is witty and unique (I guess this would be the development of self concept) but now that I look at it through the lense of psychological term, it seems to me more annoying than unique.

          </p>
          <h3><a id="et"></a>Entity theorists</h3>
          <p>
            “Entity theorists” are the people the believe that “human traits are fixed  and thus people should not be expected to change”(slide 9, Chapter 4).
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to further elaborate on this concept mainly because it struck me quite absurd especially in comparison with the other material in this and the preceding lectures. I can not see how the “entitists” would have responded to the story that opened the lecture—about the North Korean intelligence officer  Kim Hyun Hee that had a clear change of traits and, I would argue from what I know, her entire self concepts.
	A more broad concern would be with the message of recent psychology developments that seem to suggest that both nature and nurture do contribute to the development of individual and seems contrary to everything that has supported this theory directly or indirectly.
	Finally, I seem the implication of the theory—the concept of Learned Helplessness—to be quite a false amd net-negative due to its misleading nature  application(after all is it not in the point of theories to be useful?). Chiefly so because it allows people to shift blame away from their laziness towards a third party. Sounds pretty Communist to me. Just kidding. But I do truly believe that this is the sort of self reinforcement that results in poor actions.
          </p>

          <h3><a id=""></a>H</h3>
          <p>
            Week 4 ---> No Info. Polar Vortex and review.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="att"></a>Attributions</h3>
          <p>
            The causal explanations people give for their own and others’ behaviors, and for events in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some inexplicable reason I found the concept of attributions to strike the same note as the concept of self schemas did in week 2. I would attribute this to my thinking about the fact that this is these seemingly disparate concepts both seem to, at least in some capacity, to relate to the same idea of positioning an individual against his or her surroundings. That is, attributions seem to be fundamentally predicated on the fact that an individual lives, operate, and in many if not all aspects defines himself within the socium.
	I noticed this relationship during the lecture when I started thinking about how after a difficult exam I tend to blame the difficulty of the material, the “incompetence” of my professor and some other external factors. I assume this would make it a Stable External attribution as the causes are external and permanent. Whereas if I come out of an exam, especially a Computer Science One, knowing that I passed all the test cases and all that, I would begin to see myself as a capable programmer with a promising future in the software engineering field where I am much more capable than the external ones.
I tend to notice a lot in others too: after a particularly difficult math exam, Purdue social media pages steam with comments about the ambiguity of the curve, difficulty of the questions, and the incompetence of the professors.

P.S. Would me making such judgements about others count as actor/observer effect?

          </p>
          <h3><a id="emotIn"></a>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is defined in the textbook as the ability to perceive, access and generate, understand, and reflectively regulate emotions.

          </p>
          <p>
            What especially resonated with me about the topic of emotional intelligence, is the quote by Howard Gardner that opened the relevant section in the textbook: “Many people with IQs of 160 work for people with IQs of 100, if the former have poor interpersonal intelligence and the latter have a high one.”(224) I might have found this compelling for several reasons, probably including the fact that I definitely do not have an IQ above 160.
I primarily find this quote relatable due to the fact that I have experienced this myself quite regularly throughout my conscious life. In my computer science classes I often encounter people who are extremely intellectually talented. It is the same people that I see often struggling in more social tasks such as their ability to “read the room” and tune their own emotional expressions and body language to the demands of the situation.
On a more introspective note, I often my mindself split about my emotional intelligence. Sometimes, when I successfully convince people to agree with me or to join me in some undertaking, I feel remarkably social and confident in my EQ. Other times, however, I might do something remarkably stupid and let my emotions get the best of me and lash out on a person that I find extremely important to me. This makes me seriously question my ability to interact with other human beings. This dichotomy does lead me to believe that our emotional state prior to the interaction plays an important role in how we will be able to emotionally interact with others.

          </p>
          <h3><a id=meef></a>Mere Exposure Effect</h3>
          <p>
            Mere Exposure Effect is the tendency for people to come to like things simply because they see or encounter them repeatedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I read the definition, I began wondering how much of my convictions, desires, objective, romantic endeavours, and attitudes in general, are a consequence of or have been to some extent influenced by the Mere Exposure Effect.
	The most striking example of this was my first girlfriend. Or one of the first. I do not really remember to be honest. Point being that when I met her, we were at a tiny school where there was a grand total of seven people attending my grade. And she was one of the two girls there. We end up having a classical emotional roller coaster of a relationship until I left to a different school and did not see her as often, by when I stopped really caring about her and we separated as if we had barely known each other. Statistically speaking, it is all but unlikely that I would find the “love of my life” in a tiny class among the grand sample size of two, but this was as close to “love” if there even is such a thing.
	My personal experience can be generalized to the common knowledge that longg-distance relationships are harder to sustain and often end up in break ups. I think this is a great example of the mere exposure effect and points to the evidence that attitudes should be maintained through continuous exposure, or else they will be replaced by something else.

          </p>
          <h3><a id="normIn"></a>Normative influence</h3>
          <p>
            Normative influence is defined as “going along with the crowd in order to be liked and accepted.” The one who conforms due to this influence might not necessarily believe into what the group is doing is right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The discussion about the normative influence really got me thinking about how much do I myself fall victim to such influence. The reason I use the word “victim”, is that I think normative influence, compared to informational influence is the less useful one, feeling like some relic of the evolution from the time when being ostracized promises a pretty much imminent death. I think in general, when people give up their opinions and values just to be liked by a random group of five to seven people.
	The reason I find it applicable to me is that I find myself strongly influenced by the group of friends to do things I quite often tend to regret doing the next morning. I do not mean just drug abuse, I can influence myself to do that. I am more specifically talking about situations when I have made up my mind to go to bed early on Friday and wake up the next day at cheerful eight o’clock and have myself a nice long productive day. But then my friends come along and suggest to watch a movie and the next thing I know is that in three hours will be the time I was planning on waking up and my entire saturday is gone. I might be also falling prey to my friends’ unintentional use of the foot-in-the-door technique as well.

          </p>
          <h3><a id="recip"></a>Reciprocity</h3>
          <p>
            Reciprocity in our class was defined as the (pg 307) obligation to return in kind what another has done for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past five years, without really asking for it, I was frequently drawn into discussing morality, why we do what we do, and is it all possible to be genuinely nice. This discussion also evokes the debate of altruism versus egoism that was also covered in our class lectures but I believe that the concept of reciprocity is more fundamental in my understanding.
I have read that the way early humans have evolved in the “early days” was using to “modes” of cooperation. The first one is called kin selection that supported kin-based cooperation. But kin groups can only be so big and to reap the benefits of cooperating in even bigger social groups humans have evolved what the book called “reciprocal altruism”. This to me sounds quite a lot like the an oxymoron. I believe that it is this reciprocity proneness that forms the foundation of morality, religion and a sense of fairness and such. I understand that it is quite a big topic but given how often I find myself thinking again about it, I think it is quite important.

          </p>
          <h3><a id="fah"></a>Frustration–aggression hypothesis</h3>
          <p>
            Frustration–aggression hypothesis is said to be the idea that frustration always elicits the motive to aggress, and all aggression is caused by frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I normally do not think of myself as an overly aggressive person (much prefer to be known as passive-aggressive).  But the lecture today did get me started on thinking what are the times I feel like slitting someone’s throat and what might be the cause of such irrationally aggressive impulses. I think from the lense of the  frustration–aggression hypothesis it depends on the definition of frustration. I understand frustration as an unpleasant feeling arriving due to the inability to achieve a desired outcome. I think that under this definition of aggression I can not think of counterexample to the frustration–aggression hypothesis where aggression would not be associated with frustration. But then again, this feels to be a very stretched out definition and almost too ambiguous to be an operation one.
          </p>

          <h3><a id="ntb"></a>Need to belong</h3>
          <p>
            Human beings have a fundamental drive to be emotionally connected to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess the reason I resonated with this is that it is really a fundamental. Lol. Due to my moving around quite a bit and consequently switching a total of five schools, I feel like I have a lot of experience with the need to belong and the different facets of it. When I was told at the age of eight that I am leaving Russia for India I vividly remember crying because I thought I would never see my best friends again. I came into a new school, culture, language, demographic and was an outsider by pretty much all metrics imaginable. But I adjusted and found friends. This leads me to an observation about the similarity effect in forming relationships: similarities are not set in stone for a large part and one can develop new ones and adapt to the societal norms around to “fit in” and have rewarding social life in pretty much any society.
	When it came time for me to leave India, I almost convinced my parents to let me stay at a boarding school there as I yet again did not want to lose my friends. Same thing happened again when I was once more leaving Russia, now to finish my high school in here in the U.S. When it came graduation day I left my school with nearly zero hesitation and nostalgia. Not because I hated it (not enough) but mostly because I already knew this separation to be the norm. This leads me to wondering whether I now have a decreased need to belong and a better tolerance of being alone and not having strong attachments to anybody. Maybe there is a research thesis here somewhere.
          </p>

          <h3><a id="coolef"></a>Coolidge effect</h3>
          <p>
            Coolidge effect, in the textbook, is defined as the sexually arousing power of a new partner (greater than the appeal of a familiar partner).
          </p>
          <p>
            I might have chosen to write about a term less loaded and easier to handle in a written report, but when I have read the definition of the Coolidge effect I resonated with it more than I feel comfortable admitting. Not to say that I condone cheating or think it is appropriate or anything else along those lines but, from what I have seen in my friend circle, Coolidge effect is one of the stronger underwater current (at least on the male side) that is responsible for the negative aspects of the relationship. From my and my friends’ experience, I would like to claim that the Coolidge effect is exacerbated, by orders of magnitude, by the relationship being long distance. I have had the malady to experience this myself. When your partner is thousands of kilometers and multiple time zones away it is sometimes very hard to stay committed when if a great temptation happens to arise.
On the other hand, I found through observation, that experiencing the coolidge effect is followed, with little delay, by a pretty substantial and profound feeling of shame. I think this is at least indirect an indirect evidence of the idea that we have discussed in class that relationships are not only a physical attraction but also a social and emotional one.

          </p>

          <h3><a id="interIn"></a>Interracial interactions</h3>
          <p>
            Interracial interactions were mentioned in the lecture as interactions between individuals of different races.

          </p>
          <p>
            I have a fair amount to say about the feelings and anxieties one has when interacting with a person of a different race. And not only because I myself am from Russia which, even though is not super different visually as far as different races at Purdue go, still makes me feel pretty different from your average lacrosse player.
Anyhow, I related to this topic a lot because of my observation of how my interactions with African American friends here differ from my interactions with my friends from Africa. In short, I find it much easier to establish close relationships with the latter, which leads me to hypothesize that African Americans activate metastereotypes to a higher extent and express them more acutely. I have a few friends from Cameroon and Nigeria and whenever we run into each other hammered out of our minds at one out of the grand total of four bars in West Lafayette, they always invite me to join their group, go dance, play poker or just hang in general. When I meet African Americans, they seem noticeably more closed off to such interactions and stay closed within their group when they are with one.
There could be a myriad of other explanations but the concept of metastereotypes in the context of interracial interactions immediately popped this into my mind.

          </p>

          <h3><a id="socLoaf"></a>Social Loafing</h3>
          <p>
            Social Loafing occurs when people work with less zeal in a group than they would when working by themselves (aka one becomes a free rider).
          </p>
          <p>
            For some time now I have been always involved in some group endeavours either in class or outside. The group was in charge of either developing something for a grade or organizing an event for the larger community. In all the cases I have not only observed social loafing, but also discovered that the extent of social loafing in a group is inversely proportional to the eventual success of the endeavour, be it a grade, a turnout to the social that was planned or any other outcome that the group was assembled to achieve in the first place.
As part of a committee that was involved in planning a social event I quickly discovered that some people were much more interested in making a great social than others which did not take long to reflect in their own work. While everything was done, tasks that were assigned to highly motivated people were accomplished with much greater outcomes.
This led me now to think about a few ways to mitigate social loafing. My first takeaway would be to assign more important tasks to people that are more motivated to do then. Doubly so, if the task involves motivating others to accomplish a goal as I believe that the unenthusiasm will do the opposite of persuading others to join.
